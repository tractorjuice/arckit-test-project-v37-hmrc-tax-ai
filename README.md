# HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) — Tax Compliance AI & Revenue Intelligence Platform

An architecture governance project using [ArcKit](https://github.com/tractorjuice/arc-kit) to design and govern the **Tax Compliance AI & Revenue Intelligence Platform** for **HM Revenue and Customs**.

## Background

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) collects over £800 billion in tax revenue annually and administers the UK's tax, payments, and customs systems. With over 45 million individual taxpayers and 6 million businesses, HMRC handles massive data volumes. AI can transform tax compliance, fraud detection, customer service, and the Making Tax Digital programme.

| **Tax Fraud Detection** | ML models for identifying tax evasion, avoidance schemes, and fraudulent claims |
| **Compliance Risk Scoring** | AI-powered risk scoring of tax returns for targeted compliance interventions |
| **Making Tax Digital AI** | AI tools to support MTD adoption, error detection, and automated tax calculations |
| **Customer Service AI** | NLP-powered chatbots and automated response for taxpayer queries |
| **Customs AI** | AI for customs declarations processing, risk assessment, and trade facilitation post-Brexit |
| **R&D Tax Credit AI** | Automated assessment and fraud detection for R&D tax credit claims |
